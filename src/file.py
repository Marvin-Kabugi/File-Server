class FileReader:
    """
    A utility class for reading and managing file content.

    This class allows you to read the content of a file, store it internally, and optionally reread the content
    upon request. It provides methods to initialize the file reader, read the file content, and trigger a reread
    if needed.

    Args:
        path (str): The path to the file to be read.
        reread_on_query (bool): If True, the file content will be reread from the file each time the
            `on_reread_selector` method is called.

    Attributes:
        path (str): The path to the file.
        reread_on_query (bool): Flag indicating whether rereading the file content on query is enabled.
        file_content (List[str] or FileNotFoundError): The content of the file as a list of lines, or an instance
            of FileNotFoundError if the file doesn't exist.

    Methods:
        __init__(self, path: str, reread_on_query: bool) -> None:
            Initializes the FileReader instance with the given file path and reread configuration.

        _read_file(self):
            Reads the content of the file located at the specified path.

        _read_file_mmap(self):
            Reads the content of the file located at the specified path.

        on_reread_selector(self):
            Returns the stored file content. If reread_on_query is True, this method will reread the file and
            update the stored content.
